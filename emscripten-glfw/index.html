    <td>The purpose of this example is to be as minimal as possible: initializes glfw, create window, then destroy it and terminate glfw.
      Uses the default shell that comes with emscripten</td>

    <td><a href="examples/example_resizable_container/main.html">example_resizable_container</a></td>
    <td>The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to make the canvas resizable with another container (a
      surrounding div) driving its size. The container width is proportional to the size of the window and so as the
      window gets resized so does the div and so does the canvas</td>
  </tr>

    <td><a href="examples/example_resizable_container_with_handle/main.html">example_resizable_container_with_handle</a></td>
    <td>The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to make the canvas resizable with a container that has a handle.
      The handle can be dragged around (left mouse drag) and the div is resized accordingly which in turn resizes the
      canvas, making the canvas truly resizable like a window</td>
